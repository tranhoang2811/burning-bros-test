# Burning Bros Technical Test

This repository contains the source code for the Burning Bros technical test. The project involves crawling data from a specified website, storing the data, and analyzing the dataset.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the source code, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Crawling Script

The crawling logic is implemented in the `crawling.py` file. To run the crawling script, execute the `main.py` file:

    python main.py

### Data Storage

The crawled data will be stored in the `data` folder. Ensure that this directory exists or the script will create it for you.

### Data Analysis
